(What is the problem?)

(Why is this a problem?)

(How we solve it?)

(Example scenario)

**To illustrate the process of finding relevant information, the
location of the data and who is consuming this one, the following
scenario is described:**

   Aurelius Atlas Data Governance Solution provides the person in charge
   of a data set with checking which government information has been
   filled in correctly, so you can define governance quality rules in
   the government system.

   If you want to know more about governance quality rules, click here.

   This gives the person responsible for archiving that information and
   monitoring it as a business owner the idea of whether everyone has
   done that and what the quality of the government data that has been
   recorded is from structural a point of view.

   Completing data governance information can be overwhelming, so the
   tool can help determine how this process is passing through data
   governance quality checks.

   On the side of each card in the search, you can see a little icon
   that determines if the information about this entity is complete or
   not.

   If you click on the entity details page, you can see what data
   governance controls have been performed.

   ``1 - Press on the button.``

   ``2 – Select Governance Quality Rules.``

   This indicates to the person responsible if the entity is complete or
   not, in this example we see that the data domain has no data
   entities.

   This suggests that is incomplete and more information should be
   added.
