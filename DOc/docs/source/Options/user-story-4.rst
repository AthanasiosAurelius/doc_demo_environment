User Story

    What is Lorem Ipsum?
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
    orem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
    like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    Why do we use it?
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
    The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
    making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 
    'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose 
    (injected humour and the like).

``1 - Data quality.``

``2 – Press on the button.``

``3 - Selec Fields.``


Here we can see the quality of each field and identify where the quality is not up to standard.

If your project only requires **FTE** and **location** fields in which the quality is high, 
you can ignore the lower quality of the unrelated fields.

However, if you require the **HIER ORGANIZATION** field, 
you can notice that the precision is low.

Let’s go to the Data Quality Rules

``1 - Press on the button.``

``2 – Select Data Quality Rules.``


You can see that the syntax of the field is not always being followed.

With this information, you can now understand the limitations of the dataset.

Let’s go to the Data Attributes

.. image:: imgs-user-story4/eigth.jpg

``1 - Press on the button.``

``2 – Select Data Attributes.``

As you can see in this picture:

.. image:: imgs-user-story4/nine.jpg

``1 - Name and results.``

``2 - Filter and search bar.``

``3 - Attributes.``

``4 - People in charge of this data.``

This way, your data is always updated and you're guaranteed better quality, 
because you can know who oversees it and ask them to clean it up.

**Benefits**

**1 – Great insight into data quality.**

**2 – Easy to find the person in charge of the data.**
