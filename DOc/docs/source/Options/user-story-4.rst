(What is the problem?)

(Why is this a problem?)

(How we solve it?)

(Example scenario)

**To illustrate the process of finding relevant information, the
location of the data and who is consuming this one, the following
scenario is described:** A implementer of data pipeline, you want to
update schema of a particular table, so you want to know who is using
the data and where are this different data being used to make sure that
they also adjust their schema and the subsequent pipelines.

   As a user, you can be interested in having a clear vision of the
   quality of your data and how you can obtain the best quality from it.

   Let’s look for some data, found a data set and go to its page.

   You have, an overview of the overall data quality of the data set can
   be seen.

   What we see here is that the quality is not a hundred percent.



   Let’s go to this section, to see the fields:

``1 - Press on the button.``

``2 – Select Fields.``



   Here we can see the quality of each field and identify where the
   quality is not being met.


   If your project only requires FTE and location fields in which the
   quality is high, you can ignore the bad quality of the unrelated
   fields.


   However, if you require the HIER ORGANIZATION field, you can notice
   that the precision is low.



   Let’s go to the Data Quality Rules:

``1 - Press on the button.``

``2 – Select Data Quality Rules.``



   You can see that the syntax of the field is not always being
   followed.



   With this information, you can now understand the limitations of the
   dataset.

   Let’s go to the Data Attributes:

``1 - Press on the button.``

``2 – Select Data Attributes.``



   As you can see in this picture:

 

``1. Name and results.``

``2 Filter and search bar.``

``3 Attributes.``

``4 People in charge of this data.``

   In this way, you can have your data always updated to always
   guarantee good quality in it, because you can know who is in charge
   of it and ask them to clean it up.



Benefits:

**1 – Great insight into data quality.**

**2 – Easy to find the person in charge of the data.**

**3 – Take actions to improve data quality.**

**4 – Reduce operational errors.**

**5 – Increase analytics accuracy.**

**6 – Improve efficiency.**
