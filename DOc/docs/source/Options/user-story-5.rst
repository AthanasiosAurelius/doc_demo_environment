    User story
    ----------

    Aurelius Atlas Data Governance Solution provides the person in charge of a data set with checking which government information has been filled in correctly, 
    so you can define governance quality rules in the government system. 
    This gives the person responsible for archiving that information and monitoring it as a business owner the idea of whether everyone has done that and 
    what the quality of the government data that has been recorded is from structural a point of view. 
    Completing data governance information can be overwhelming, so the tool can help determine how this process is passing through data governance quality checks. 


    Step by step guide
    ------------------
    
    Let’s start from the business context card 

    .. image:: imgs-user-story5/one.jpg

    ``1 – Click on start browsing data domains.`` 

    
    On the side of each card in the search, 
    you can see a little icon that determines if the information about this entity is complete or not. 

    .. image:: imgs-user-story5/two.jpg

    ``1 - Data type.``

    ``2 -  This checkmark means the entity is fully populated.``

    .. image:: imgs-user-story5/three.jpg

    ``2 - This warning symbol means that the entity is not filled.``

    .. image:: imgs-user-story5/four.jpg

    Let’s click on Logistics entity 

    .. image:: imgs-user-story5/five.jpg

    Once there let’s go to the Governance Quality Rules: 

    ``1 - Press on the button.``

    ``2 – Select Governance Quality Rules.``

    .. image:: imgs-user-story5/six.jpg

    This indicates to the person responsible if the entity is complete or not, 
    in this example we see that the data domain has no data entities. 

    **Benefits**  

    ``1 – See how well data governance has been applied.`` 

    ``2 – Control about your data.`` 

    ``3  – Empower business decisions.``
